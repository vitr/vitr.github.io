The PHP Coding Standards Fixer tool fixes most issues in your code when you want to follow the PHP coding standards as defined in the PSR-1 and PSR-2 documents.
If you are already using PHP_CodeSniffer to identify coding standards problems in your code, you know that fixing them by hand is tedious, especially on large projects. This tool does the job for you.
