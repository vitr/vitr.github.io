## Notes on programming languages

Good languages help evolve your approach to programming; LISP shows you the idea of code as data, C teaches you about working with the machine at a lower level, Ruby teaches you about message passing & lambdas, Erlang teaches you about concurrency and fault tolerance, Haskell teaches you about real type systems and purity, Rust presumably teaches you about sharing memory in a concurrent environment. I just donâ€™t think I got much from learning Go.
